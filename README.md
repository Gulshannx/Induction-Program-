# Day2 
My second day at GNDEC was also too good. As to be honest i reached college  late. I reached college late by about 30 minutes .There was a English Proficiency test on the second day at 9.30 but reached at 10.00 am so i missed the test. Then i went to classroom and attended my Math proficiency test. The test went good. After that we all got a break from 11.30 to 1.oo pm.

Then everyone went to Auditorium of the college. Where Dr.Arshdeep singh gave a lecture on Food, value of food etc. They told us about good food bad food and as a enginineers we all need a healthy food . They also suggested the food which are good for us. Then the lecture Got ended at 2.00pm
At 2.00 pm students of Causmic club ( 4th year students) launch an induction . They told us how tu use GitHub. Value of Github in cse,it department,and as a senior they suggested us What should we do to get a better placement.
After that the induction got ended. 

I feel too good,learrn new things at my college as a second day.
